\section{Course program}
	
	In the following table you can see the program of the course, divided in lesson units. Each lesson unit is also associated with the corresponding book paragraphs. The last lesson unit of the course is reserved for a summary in preparation for the exam. \\
	Note: Lesson units are intented as collections of topics and do not necessarily correspond to study weeks (for example, a lesson unit could span two study weeks). \\
