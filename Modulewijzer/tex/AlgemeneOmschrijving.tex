\section{General description}
	Designing and manipulating efficient data structures is at the foundation of computer programming. 
	These data structures solve complex problems through well-known, highly difficult techniques that would simply take too long to rediscover for every application. When faced with certain classes of issues, lack of knowledge of algorithms and data structures might significantly impact a programmer's ability to tackle a given problem efficiently and effectively. \\	
	In this course we are going to explain some popular algorithms and data structures used in a variety of scenario's encountered in practice when dealing with structuring and traversal of data. \\

\subsection{Relationship with other teaching units}
	This course builds upon the development courses of the first year.	\\		
		
	Knowledge acquired through the algorithms course is also useful for some of the projects. A word of warning though: projects and development courses are largely independent, so some things that a student learns during the development courses are not used in the projects, some things that a student learns during the development courses are indeed used in the projects, but some things done in the projects are learned within the context of the project and not within the development courses. Moreover, the whole Informatica program is not based on the \textquotedblleft workshop\textquotedblright{} philosophy but rather on building solid foundations preparing students for the future evolutions of computer science (see for instance the module description of Development 1).
